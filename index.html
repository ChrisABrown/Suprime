        <h2>Bio and Hobbies</h2>
        <p>A little bit about me, I was born in Bridgeport, CT and raised between Bridgeport and Houston, Texas by my parents who emigrated here from Jamaica in the 80s. I have one brother, no sisters, and plenty of cousins. I've been back in Texas for close to 4 years now after moving back once before from Brooklyn and recently from Middletown, NY. I have a fiancee and a 9 year-old son, Lucas, who shares my love of <span class="accent-box">
